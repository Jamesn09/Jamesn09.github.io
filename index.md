### CPSC 120
* Lab 8

    Lab 8, part 2 was definitely a favorite because when I think about code I want to see how I can implement it into something I would find useful or something I would use. Saving a message into a file by learning how to open and close files is interesting to me because a lot of the labs donâ€™t save any output after running but this lab changes that and is something I can add to other programs to save to a file.

* Lab 8

    Lab 8, part 3 is another favorite of mine because the animations that we could play by opening a file was just simply entertaining to watch, and dealing with files is something I want to improve on because of how interesting these labs were when we were learning about them. 

* Lab 6

    Lab 6, part 1 was a fun lab to work on because it was almost like a puzzle trying to get the program to itterate correctly and print out the pattern that we wanted. I learned how to make a program iterate through a loop that prints out a pattern using our past experience with loops.
